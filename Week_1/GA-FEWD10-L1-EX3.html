<!--Task ======================== Your Grandma wants you to publish her famous cookie recipe to the world wide web, she's typed it out for you in this .html document (she's so nice). She absolutely wants the directions to appear in order in a numbered list. The cookies won't taste good if you don't get the order right. (hint you need an ordered list). Your Grandpa happens to be a great Graphic Designer and gave you the following specs to style: Cookie Recipe CSS ================= - The background color for the page is #FFE - The color for the text reading "Nutrition Information" is #887 - The link color is #900 Bonus: The border on the page and around the image is black
